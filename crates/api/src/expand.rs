//! Selector expansion: turning one `SnapshotPolicy` source into N concrete
//! per-PVC backups (#346).
//!
//! # The model
//!
//! A `SnapshotPolicy` source is exactly one of `pvc`, `nfs`, or `pvcSelector`.
//! The first two name a single thing; the third matches many. Kopiur's whole
//! data model is built on **one `Snapshot` CR = one mover Job = one kopia
//! source path = one kopia manifest**, owned via a finalizer — retention,
//! restore, the catalog and the deletion policy all rest on that 1:1. So a
//! selector is expanded into N *ordinary* `Snapshot` CRs, one per matched PVC,
//! each of which is then indistinguishable from a hand-written single-PVC
//! backup.
//!
//! Expansion happens **once, at mint time**, in whichever component creates the
//! CR — a `SnapshotSchedule` fire or `kubectl kopiur snapshot now`. A `Snapshot`
//! never expands itself: a CR minting sibling CRs would re-enter the same
//! reconciler for each child and break the one-shot `run_decision` discipline,
//! and a `SnapshotPolicy` that minted invocations would collapse the
//! recipe/invocation/schedule split the project is built around.
//!
//! # What was here before
//!
//! Nothing. `pvcSelector` was schema-valid, admission-accepted, documented on
//! six pages and shipped as `deploy/examples/04-multi-pvc-selector.yaml` — and
//! no expansion code existed anywhere, so `build_backup_run` hit its
//! `_ =>` arm and returned `invariant violated … This is likely a bug in
//! kopiur`. That is #346.
