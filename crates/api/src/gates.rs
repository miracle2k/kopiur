//! The **structural-gate registry**: the one enumeration of the condition
//! `type`/`status`/`reason` triples that mean "this object is blocked on
//! something only a human can change".
//!
//! A *structural* gate is not a transient retry. It never self-heals: the
//! reconciler parks the object (usually at `phase: Pending`) and waits for an
//! out-of-band change — a namespace opt-in annotation, a credentials `Secret`,
//! an acknowledgement timestamp. Because the phase itself stays unremarkable,
//! anything that diagnoses a cluster by phase alone reports all-green while the
//! work is wedged (issue #359: `kubectl kopiur doctor` passed all checks with a
//! `Snapshot` stuck on `MoverPermitted=False`).
//!
//! The fix is to make the gate set **shared by construction**. The controller
//! writes conditions from these rows and the CLI's `doctor` iterates the same
//! rows, so a gate added on the server side cannot be invisible to the client
//! side: there is exactly one list, in `kopiur-api`, which both depend on.
//!
//! This module is pure data + pure functions — no `kube::Client`, no `tokio` —
//! per the `api` ↔ `controller` split.
