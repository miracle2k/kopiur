//! Cross-field validation the type system can't express (ADR §2.2 principle 8).
//!
//! These are the rules a single struct's types can't enforce: "field X is
//! forbidden only when sibling Y has a particular variant," "this string must
//! parse as a cron," "a discovered backup may only Retain." They live here as pure

//! defensively** — one validator, two callers (SKILL hard-rule 4). No `kube::Client`,
//! no `tokio`.
//!
//! ## Fail-fast vs. accumulate (see [`crate::error`])
//!
//! Single-rule helpers return [`ValidationResult`] (fail-fast — first problem).
//! The per-CRD aggregate validators (`validate_backup_config`, …) return
//! `Vec<ValidationError>` so a user sees every independent problem in one apply.
//! An empty vec means valid.

///   "source PVC not found" or, far worse, silently snapshotting a
///   SAME-NAMED PVC in the policy's own namespace under the matched one's
///   identity. Use one `SnapshotPolicy` per namespace.
/// * **An unusable `matchExpressions` entry is rejected** rather than dropped.
///   The generated schema does not enum-constrain `operator`, so a typo (`in`
///   for `In`) would otherwise be silently discarded — WIDENING the selector, so
///   PVCs the user meant to exclude get backed up. An `In`/`NotIn` with no
///   values renders as `key in ()`, which the API server rejects with a 400 that
