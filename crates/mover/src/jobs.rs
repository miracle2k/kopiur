//! Mover `Job` + `ConfigMap` construction (ADR §4.10 / §4.11).
//!
//! The controller delegates every long-running kopia operation to a mover
//! `Job`: it writes a `ConfigMap` holding the serialized [`MoverWorkSpec`] and
//! creates a `Job` that mounts it and runs the kopiur-mover image. This module
//! is the **pure builder** — given resolved inputs it produces the two objects
//! with the security-context, `backoffLimit`, and `activeDeadlineSeconds`
//! defaults the ADR mandates (§4.10/§4.11/G16). No `kube::Client`, no IO, so it
//! is unit-tested directly.
//!
//! It lives in the mover crate (next to [`MoverWorkSpec`], the other half of the
//! controller↔mover contract) so non-controller callers — the `kubectl kopiur`
//! plugin's browse-session spawner, external tooling — can build byte-identical
//! mover Jobs without depending on the controller. The controller re-exports it
//! unchanged from `kopiur_controller::jobs`.
