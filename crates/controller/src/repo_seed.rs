//! `spec.seed` — the controller half of seeding a brand-new repository from an
//! existing replica (issue #380).
//!
//! Shared by BOTH repository reconcilers, because everything here is identical
//! for a namespaced `Repository` and a cluster-scoped `ClusterRepository` once
//! the caller supplies the three namespaces that actually differ: the one the
//! bootstrap Job runs in, the one a namespace-less `seed.from.repository`
//! reference resolves in, and the one the seed backend's `tls.caBundleRef`
//! ConfigMap is read from. See [`SeedContext`].
//!
//! The load-bearing idea is the **seed-attempt marker**
//! (`kopiur_api::seed::SeedStatus::started_at`), stamped into `status.seed`
//! BEFORE a seeding bootstrap Job is created and never cleared. It is what
//! distinguishes "a seed this operator started did not finish" (resume the
//! copy) from "this backend was initialized by somebody else" (an ordinary
//! adoption, which keeps the no-clobber `AlreadyInitialized` no-op). A resuming
//! migrate re-runs `kopia snapshot migrate` into whatever repository is at the
//! backend and then re-stamps its maintenance owner, with no kopia-side
//! backstop — blob mode gets one for free, since `sync-to` refuses a
//! destination whose format blob differs from the source's — so the marker, and
//! nothing weaker, decides `resume`.
