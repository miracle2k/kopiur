//! The `Snapshot` reconciler — the heart of the ADR §5.5 thesis.
//!
//! Two paths:
//! 1. **Normal reconcile** (produced backups): add the `kopiur.home-operations.com/snapshot-cleanup`
//!    finalizer, create a mover `Job` + `ConfigMap` (work spec), watch it to a
//!    terminal state, copy stats/phase into `status`, and reap (owner-ref GC).
//! 2. **Deletion** (finalizer present, `deletionTimestamp` set): run the
//!    EXHAUSTIVE [`plan_deletion`] decision, execute its IO, then remove the
//!    finalizer.
//!
//! [`plan_deletion`] is a pure function over [`DeletionFacts`] returning a
//! [`DeletionPlan`]. It is the single most important thing to get right and is
//! exhaustively unit-tested — every `match` over `DeletionPolicy`,
//! `ScheduleDeletePolicy`, `NamespaceDeletePolicy`, `OwnerState`, and
//! `BreakerState` has **no** `_ =>` arm, so a new variant of any of them cannot
//! compile until handled (SKILL thesis).
