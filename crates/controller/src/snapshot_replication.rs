//! The `SnapshotReplication` reconciler (issue #368) — logical (snapshot-level)
//! replication between two repository CRs via `kopia snapshot migrate`.
//!
//! Mirrors the `RepositoryReplication` scheduler (`crate::repository_replication`):
//! the controller is the *scheduler*. Each reconcile it decides whether a
//! replication is due (croner + deterministic jitter via
//! [`crate::snapshot_schedule::next_fire`], seeded by the CR UID), gates on BOTH
//! repositories being Ready (source and destination are real repository CRs
//! here, unlike blob replication's inline destination backend), on the
//! destination being writable, and on the runtime identity-overlap check, then
//! spawns at most one per-slot owned mover Job and tracks it to terminal. The
//! mover PATCHes `.status` (phase, `lastReplicated`, `lastRun`) and reconciles
//! the dest-side copy `Snapshot` CRs.
//!
//! Hardening matches replication/maintenance: per-slot deterministic Job names,
//! single-flight via a label selector, a requeue cap, and transition-guarded
//! status. Two extras live in the idle (not-due) arm: the cross-namespace
//! discovered-duplicate reap for `ClusterRepository` destinations (plan A6 —
//! the namespaced mover cannot delete a duplicate that materialized in another
//! namespace), and the projected-credentials reap (no live copy of either
//! repository's Secrets lingers between runs).
