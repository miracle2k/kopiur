//! The `Restore` reconciler (ADR §4.6, §4.7).
//!
//! Resolves the source (`snapshotRef` / `fromPolicy` / `identity`), pins
//! `status.resolved`, creates a restore mover `Job`, and handles the passive
//! populator mode (a PVC's `spec.dataSourceRef` points at the `Restore`).
//!
//! The source-mode dispatch is an **exhaustive `match`** over the externally
//! tagged `RestoreSource` enum (no `_ =>`), and [`default_on_missing`] /
//! [`populator_state`] are pure decisions, all unit-tested. The populator path
//! ([`drive_populator_restore`]) implements the full CSI volume-populator
//! handshake: restore into a controller-created **prime** PVC, then rebind its PV
//! to the claiming PVC (mirrors `kubernetes-csi/lib-volume-populator`).

/// - **`waitTimeout` interaction.** Clearing this gate is what OPENS the wait window
///   ([`ensure_wait_anchor`], #380): time parked here does NOT consume it, and the
///   window is both opened and evaluated only against a Ready repository. Once open
///   it is an ABSOLUTE deadline anchored at `status.waitStartedAt` (see
///   `resolve_snapshot` — spec'd so the in-Job wait is stable across pod retries), so
///   a repository outage can never fail a restore — or fake a `Continue` empty-volume
///   outcome — by silently burning the window while the backend is down.
///
/// **Tri-state (issue #393).** "Ready", "not Ready" and "cannot tell" are three
/// answers, and the gate used to give two: every cannot-tell shape fell through
/// as if the repository had been verified, so `ensure_wait_anchor` stamped the
/// window against nothing. Now a MISSING referent — the `Repository` object
/// itself, or the `fromPolicy` `SnapshotPolicy` its ref derives from — parks as
/// [`RepositoryGate::Undetermined`] with its own reason, no anchor stamped. Two
/// cannot-tell shapes still deliberately proceed: a `snapshotRef` whose
/// `Snapshot` row does not exist yet (that IS what the window waits for, and
/// `onMissingSnapshot: Fail` must be able to fire for a typo'd ref) and a
/// referent that exists but derives no single repository (a spec bug for
/// downstream validation to fail closed on). See [`RepoRefLookup`].
///
/// **Wake-up contract.** The `Repository`/`ClusterRepository` → `Restore` watches
/// cover only an explicit `spec.repository` (`watch::repository_to_restores`);
/// there is NO `SnapshotPolicy` → `Restore` watch. An `Undetermined` park
/// therefore un-parks on its own 15s requeue, not on an event — which is why
/// every `Undetermined` arm must return a requeue. (Adding the missing watch is
/// a possible follow-up; the requeue is correct either way.)
///
/// Only a restore that has NOT launched its mover Job is gated
/// ([`restore_awaiting_launch`]); a `Restoring` restore's live Job is tracked to
/// terminal, never re-gated, mirroring the Snapshot reconciler's ordering. (Narrow
/// crash window: a Job created moments before the controller died — before the

/// - a `snapshotRef` whose `Snapshot` ROW does not exist yet — that row is exactly what
///   the window is waiting for, and parking instead would prevent `onMissingSnapshot:
///   Fail` from ever firing for a typo'd ref;

///   downstream by `resolve_restore_repository`).
///
/// The ordering still guarantees the thing that matters, and now guarantees it for the
/// slow-arriving-referent case too: a restore parked waiting for its backend — or for the
/// object that names it — never opens a window.
///
/// Both halves of the condition are about a restore that cannot yet do anything measuring
/// a window it will need later:
/// - **Repository readiness.** A `Restore` applied by GitOps alongside its `Repository`
///   sits on the gate until the backend comes up. Anchored at creation, an outage longer
///   than `waitTimeout` means the first pass that reaches resolution already finds the
///   window closed and applies `onMissingSnapshot` — for `fromPolicy` that defaults to
///   `Continue`, i.e. an EMPTY volume.
/// - **A claiming PVC.** Resolution runs while a populator is `AwaitingClaim`, so a
///   standing populator `Restore` created months before anything claims it would burn its
///   whole window sitting idle and pin `Empty` the moment a claim finally appears.
///
/// Returns the *effective* window rather than relying on the caller re-reading the CR: on
/// the pass that opens it the stamp is not on the `restore` we were handed, and that is
/// precisely the pass that must not fall back to the creation timestamp.
/// [`WaitWindow::AwaitingClaim`] anchors at `now`, so the full window always remains — and
/// tells the parking caller to report the claim, not a phantom snapshot wait.
///
/// Writes NOTHING but `waitStartedAt`: the conditions array is replaced wholesale by a
/// merge patch, so a second conditions writer in one reconcile would erase the first.
///
/// No window configured ⇒ no anchor stamped: the value is only ever read through
/// `waitTimeout`, so a `Restore` without one carries no `status.waitStartedAt` at all.
