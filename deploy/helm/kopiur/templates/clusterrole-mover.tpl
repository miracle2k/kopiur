# to THIS ClusterRole in each Job's namespace at runtime, so the role is shipped once
# (cluster-scoped) and bound per-namespace. The rules are a tiny subset of the
# operator's: the mover only PATCHes the owning CR's `.status` and the bootstrap
# result ConfigMap. Names/labels are Helm-templated so the chart owns them.

# that xtask is the SOURCE OF TRUTH; edit it and re-run, then re-sync these rules.
#
# A `stream` source execs a command in a running workload pod, which needs
# `pods/exec`. That verb must NEVER reach the generic mover role above: every
# ordinary mover Job in the namespace runs as that ServiceAccount, so granting it
# there would let any backup Job run arbitrary commands in any pod in the
# namespace. The controller mints the same-named ServiceAccount + a RoleBinding to
# THIS role per namespace, only for stream-source mover Jobs.
#
# `resourceNames` cannot narrow `pods/exec` further — the pod name is not known
# until the selector resolves at run time, and RBAC has no label-selector form. The
# effective bound is the namespace, which is why stream sources additionally
# require a cluster-admin namespace opt-in annotation.
